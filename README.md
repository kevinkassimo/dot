# dot
A simple but terrible util for dotfile git management / github publishing

## Basic features
To be added

## Sorry
This project will be absolutely lame. There is no support for branches: everything is commited and pushed to __master__ branch. It is created mostly just for fun and for personal use, so many advanced features will NOT be implemented (at least for now as I am a terrible programmer at this stage...)
